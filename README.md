## Getting Started üöÄ

To start using this project template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
     # or
     yarn
    ```

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

5. You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

6. [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

7. The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

8. This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
